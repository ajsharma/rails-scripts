# rails-scripts

## What is this?

A collection tools to make common Rails tasks easier. I use them every day to speed up my dev cycle.

## How to use

Simply clone the repo to your local machine and run commands from your Rails' app root folder.

(better details soon)

## ENV controls

- `RAILS_SCRIPTS__GIT_TRUNK_BRANCH_NAME` what branch to treat as the trunk, defaults to `main`
- `RAILS_SCRIPTS__VERBOSE` set to any truthy (i.e. `TRUE`) value to print system commands as they execute.
